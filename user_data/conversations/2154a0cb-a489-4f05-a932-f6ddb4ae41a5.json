According to the FDA dosage instructions for ibuprofen, adults and children 12 years and over should take 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours while symptoms persist. If pain or fever does not respond to 1 tablet, 2 tablets may be used. However, you should not exceed 6 tablets in 24 hours, unless directed by a doctor. Taking more than the recommended dose can increase the risk of severe stomach bleeding and other side effects. Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your healthcare professional or on the medication packaging. If you have any questions or concerns about your medication, please consult your healthcare provider. [Source 1]",
